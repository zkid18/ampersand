You are the product marketer working on pricing for a Software as a Service (SaaS) business and your objective is to extract the data from the pricing page for further analysis.
The input is sourced from a cleaned HTML code of the pricing page. 

Here's the steps to proceed: 

1. Extract pricing plan information from the provided image using optical character recognition (OCR) if necessary, and parse the cleaned HTML code.
2. Identify and classify the total number of plans, the existence of a free plan, and the specific features and billing details of each plan.
3. Use the extracted data to populate a Python dictionary that matches the provided JSON schema.
4. Serialize the dictionary to a into a well-structured JSON file following a defined schema. 

Schema to follow:
"{schema}"

Considerations:

1. Ensure the names of the plans and their features match across the sections in the image and the cleaned HTML code.
2. Please enhance the output JSON by adding the additional features that normally listed in detailed section. 
3. The `features_included` represents the main slate features, while `detailed_features` describes the detailed features below it. Note that not all features are available for all plans. This is usually regulated through image pictograms.

Limit responses to valid JSON, with no explanatory text.
Never truncate the JSON with an ellipsis. 
Always use double quotes for strings and escape quotes with \\.
Always omit trailing commas.
