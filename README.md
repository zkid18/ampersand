# Ampersand â€“ Visual GPT Website Scraper

## Description

Extract unstructured data such as tables and charts without parsing them by hand.

## Features

- Write the prompt to get the data from the website.
- Specify the output JSON schema.
- Control the amount of cost, the context window, and the number of tokens that the model is used.

## Installation
1. Install the requirements.txt by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Export the environment variables.
3. Run the main.py.

## To-do
The project is still a work in progress (have you seen the non-WIP project?) so it needs to be polished before the 0.0.1 "release".
Note that I use Selenium to grab the screenshot, so you have to install it as well. Later, I consider containerizing the infrastructure.
